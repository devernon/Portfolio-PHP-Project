    <p>I started learning computer programming in the early '80's while attending high school. The first languages I learned was Applesoft Basic and Pascal. My education also includes studying computer information systems at DeVry University. I'm currently taking classes at Estrella Mountain Community College in order to refresh and expand my knowledge with the latest languages and techniques.</p>
    <p>I have been doing different projects for more than 15 years. I have done these both for employers and independently. I have created websites using Flash, PHP, MySQL, ASP, Java, and CSS. I have done application development using C#.net and Visual Basic. I am currently working on a project using C# and MySQL. The application will be for import companies to track incoming containers and inventory. It will also handle both accounts receivable and accounts payable. As part of the project I will be creating a web interface for salespeople and customers to check pricing, inventory levels, and create orders.</p>
    <p>I am a quick learner and able to pick up new systems and languages quickly. I have included different examples of my work on this web site.</p>
